pwealth;'In the year 2002, the individual questionnaire included for the first time a special module focusing on wealth. This section included questions on seven different wealth components:
Owner-occupied property (including debt), other property (including debt),  financial assets, private pensions (including life insurance and building savings contracts),  business assets,  tangible assets and  consumer credit. The generated SOEP wealth data is stored in two separate data files called PWEALTH for information at the individual level and HWEALTH for correspondingly aggregated data at the household level. Wealth-related variable names in the file PWEALTH consist of six digits. The first digit tells the user which wealth component is referred to, and the second to sixth digits provide more detailed information about possible filter information, the personal share, the gross amount, and the amount of any outstanding debt. In principle a digit is coded “1” if a given variable does indeed contain this specific piece of information and “0” otherwise.  The wealth information in the SOEP questionnaire is surveyed at the individual level and thus also imputed or edited at the individual level (although checked against household information for consistency).';Wealth module;gen;long

However for all persons with valid household level information that did refuse to respond to the personal questionnaire (partial unit non-response) imputations have been carried out and the results are included in HWEALTH.';Wealth module;gen;long

timepref;Following on the behavioral experiment on trust and trustworthiness carried out in the 2003, 2004, and 2005 SOEP surveys, the experiment “time preferences” was run in 2006. In this experiment on economic behavior, respondents were asked to decide how they would want to receive €200 in prize money: if they would want to receive it immediately by check, or if they would want to wait and receive a larger amount later—that is, with interest. ;Experiment on time preferences;gen;wide
trust;'Datensatz des ökonomischen Verhaltensexperiments über Vertrauen und Vertrauenswürdigkeit aus den Befragungsjahren 2003, 2004, & 2005.

Dieses Experiment, das dazu dient, Vertrauen zu messen, basiert auf einem Investitionsspiel, das Berg et al. (1995) eingeführt haben. Es handelt sich um ein Einmalspiel für zwei Akteure, die sich anonym aufeinander beziehen. Der erste Akteur erhält ein Guthaben von zehn Punkten und kann davon eine beliebige Anzahl von Punkten der zweiten Akteurin überschreiben. Jeder überschriebene Punkt wird dabei verdoppelt. Die zweite Akteurin erhält ebenfalls ein Guthaben von zehn Punkten. Nachdem sie die (verdoppelten) Punkte vom ersten Akteur übertragen bekommen hat, entscheidet sie, wieviel sie von ihrem eigenen Guthaben an den ersten Akteur überschreibt (null bis zehn Punkte). Ebenso wie beim ersten Transfer werden auch ihre Punkte beim Empfänger verdoppelt. Nach der Entscheidung der zweiten Akteurin endet das Spiel und die Mitspieler bekommen ihr Einkommen ausbezahlt (ein Punkt entspricht dabei einem Euro, die Summe wird als Scheck ein paar Tage später versandt).

Eine grundlegende Komponente des Spiels ist, dass die Teilnehmer tatsächlich entsprechend des festgelegten Auszahlungsmodus Geld erhalten, was bedeutet, dass alle Entscheidungen immer finanzielle Konsequenzen haben. Diese Version des Spiels wurde von Fehr, Fischbacher, Schupp, von Rosenbladt & Wagner (2002) entwickelt.

Die Verbindung von Repräsentativbefragung und Verhaltensexperiment wurde in den SOEP-Haupterhebungen 2003, 2004 und 2005 durchgeführt, wobei nur geringfügige Modifizierungen vorgenommen wurden. Von ursprünglich 1.432 Personen im Jahre 2003 haben 1.202 Personen auch 2004 und 2005 am Experiment teilgenommen.
